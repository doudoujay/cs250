@Write a program sumarray.s that reads 5 numbers from stdin and prints the sum of the numbers.
@Use a loop to read in the 5 numbers so that your code could handle a larger or smaller number of input numbers.
@For example, a loop would look like this. In other words,
@do not copy/paste the scanf and format character 5 times in your program.
